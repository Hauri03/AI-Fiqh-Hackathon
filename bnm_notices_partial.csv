Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) imposed Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMP)

[[1]](#_ftn1)

 ranging from RM1,500 to RM3,000 against 10 Money Services Business (MSB) licensees (as listed in Table 1) for non-compliances with regulatory requirements between January 2024 and June 2025, relating to failure to:







- submit statistical information to BNM within the stipulated timeline[[2]](#_ftn2); or





- meet the minimum capital funds (MCF) requirement[[3]](#_ftn3).








Timely submission of statistical information is essential for BNM’s risk monitoring, statistical publications, and policymaking, while maintaining adequate capital funds is crucial for business continuity and sustainability to meet public demand for MSB services.




In deciding on the quantum of the AMP, the number of non-compliances and historical compliance records of the MSB licensees were considered.




All 10 MSB licensees have paid the respective AMP imposed by BNM and have taken remedial steps to rectify the lapses, including increasing their capital funds.




Table 1: List of the MSB licensees





| No. | Institution | Non-compliances |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Team Smart Forex Sdn. Bhd. | Failure to submit the required information within the stipulated timeline. |

On 5 December 2025, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) imposed an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)

[[1]](#_ftn1)

 of RM10,200 on Mayfair Forex Sdn. Bhd. (Mayfair) for non-compliance with the customer due diligence (CDD) requirements under section 74(3) of the Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA), read together with paragraphs 14C.4(a) and 14C.12.1 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism, Countering Proliferation Financing and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document

[[2]](#_ftn2)

 (AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD).




These provisions require Mayfair, as a reporting institution (RI), to conduct CDD on its customers. The requirement to conduct CDD is to enable RIs to assess their exposure to money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF) risks, as well as take appropriate measures to prevent RIs from facilitating ML/TF and other serious criminal activities.




BNM detected the non-compliance during an on-site examination on Mayfair. The examination revealed that Mayfair had failed to conduct CDD on a customer in relation to a money-changing transaction above RM3,000. In response, Mayfair has taken remedial measures by conducting staff training and enhancing its system to strengthen CDD compliance.




BNM has considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in determining the imposition of the AMP. This includes:







- severity of the non-compliance;





- Mayfair’s current controls to ensure compliance with the requirements, which were assessed as generally adequate;





- past compliance record of Mayfair; and





- assessment on Mayfair’s post-misconduct behaviour and the effectiveness of remedial actions taken by Mayfair to prevent recurrence of non-compliance.








Mayfair paid RM10,200 for the AMP imposed by BNM on 11 December 2025.




BNM requires all RIs to ensure compliance with AML/CFT and money services business requirements. BNM will not hesitate to take appropriate supervisory and enforcement actions should any RI fail to meet legal or regulatory requirements.




The enforcement action taken against Mayfair is in line with the approach and processes outlined in the 

[Enforcement Approach](https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/62604/BNM-Enforcement-Approach-1-Edition-2024.pdf)

On 31 October 2025, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) imposed an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)

[[1]](#_ftn1)

 of RM14,000 on Moneywave Sdn. Bhd. (Moneywave) for non-compliances with the sanctions screening requirements under section 74(3) of the Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA), read together with:







- paragraphs 27.3.1, 27.3.6, 28.2.2 and 29.2.2 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (2019 AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD); and





- paragraphs 27.3.1, 27.3.6, 28.2.2 and 29.2.2 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism, Countering Proliferation Financing and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (2024 AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD)[[2]](#_ftn2).








These provisions require Moneywave, as a reporting institution (RI), to maintain a sanctions database based on the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) List

[[3]](#_ftn3)

 and Domestic List

[[4]](#_ftn4)

. Sanctions screening is essential to protect RIs and the broader financial system from being abused for terrorism and/or proliferation financing activities.




BNM detected the non-compliances during an on-site examination. The examination revealed that Moneywave failed to maintain any sanctions database based on the UNSCR List and the Domestic List.




In response, Moneywave has taken remedial measures by subscribing to a commercial sanctions database service, which has been integrated into its currency exchange system.




BNM has considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in determining the imposition of the AMP. This includes:







- the severity of the non-compliances;





- Moneywave’s current controls to ensure compliance with the requirements, which were assessed as generally adequate;





- Moneywave’s past compliance record; and





- Moneywave’s post-misconduct behaviour and the effectiveness of remedial actions taken by Moneywave to prevent the recurrence of non-compliances.








Moneywave paid RM14,000 for the AMP on 4 November 2025.




BNM requires all RIs to ensure compliance with targeted financial sanctions requirements. BNM will not hesitate to take appropriate supervisory and enforcement actions should any RIs fail to meet legal or regulatory requirements.




The enforcement action taken against Moneywave is in line with the approach and processes outlined in the 

[Enforcement Approach](https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/62604/BNM-Enforcement-Approach-1-Edition-2024.pdf)

.




 







[[1]](#_ftnref1)

 BNM imposed the AMP pursuant to section 75(2)(b) of the Money Services Business Act 2011.




[[2]](#_ftnref2)

 The 2019 AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD was in effect from 1 January 2020 to 5 February 2024 and has since been superseded by the 2024 AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD, which took effect on 6 February 2024.




[[3]](#_ftnref3)

 UNSCR List contains a list of names and particulars of persons as designated by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) or its relevant Sanctions Committee pursuant to the relevant UNSC Resolutions (UNSCR) and are deemed as:







- specified entities by virtue of section 66C(2) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA) for Targeted Financial Sanctions on Terrorism Financing;





- designated persons under the relevant Strategic Trade Act 2010 (STA) subsidiary legislation for Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferation Financing; and





- designated persons under the relevant Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 (CBA) Regulations for Targeted Financial Sanctions under the Other UN-Sanctions Regimes.

 as well as international Islamic standard-setting bodies

[[3]](#_ftn3)

.







- Authorities from participating countries shared their experiences in advancing Islamic finance, including efforts to transition from conventional banking, align Islamic finance with national development goals, and apply social finance tools to support communities. These diverse approaches, shaped by local contexts, enriched the shared understanding and progress of the global Islamic finance landscape.











- In the area of takaful, the meeting noted the regulatory developments on broader application of ta`awun (mutual assistance) in takaful. On this, the meeting noted that BNM plans to issue a policy document on the broader application of ta`awun in takaful by end of 2025. The policy document will outline Shariah and regulatory requirements aimed at unlocking the full potential of takaful in fostering financial resilience and inclusion, in line with the objectives of Shariah (maqasid Shariah).











- The meeting also discussed recent legal reforms that recognise the takaful fund as a separate legal entity. On this, the meeting noted that Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates plans to strengthen the governance framework of takaful funds to ensure transparency, accountability, and Shariah compliance. Key mechanism highlighted to strengthen oversight include the role of the board of trustees and the establishment of a fund charter, designed to safeguard the interests of participants and beneficiaries.











- In relation to emerging instruments such as central bank digital currencies (CBDC), the meeting also discussed the fundamentals of modern money and its exploratory Shariah implications based on a foundational research paper published by BNM. The paper highlights the credit nature of modern money that is embedded in the structural relations between financial actors. This view aligns with the prevailing perspectives of major global monetary authorities and serves as an alternative to the mainstream conception of money. With this updated understanding, Shariah implications are explored to guide a clearer framework for discussions on digital money innovation.











- The meeting formally accepted the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the CSAF platform, marking a significant step in strengthening the governance structure, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and enhancing coordination among member authorities to achieve shared strategic objectives.

On 19 September 2025, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) imposed an administrative monetary penalty (AMP)

[[1]](#_ftn1)

 of RM17,400 on JAGS Money Sdn. Bhd. (JAGS) for non-compliances with customer due diligence (CDD) requirements under section 74(3) of the Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA). This is read together with paragraphs 14C.1(b), 14C.4(a) and 14C.12.1 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD)

[[2]](#_ftn2)

 involving money-changing transactions exceeding RM3,000.




Additionally, on 31 July 2025, BNM, with the consent of the Deputy Public Prosecutor, also imposed a compound

[[3]](#_ftn3)

 of RM69,600 against JAGS for its failure to comply with the requirements under section 27(1) of the MSBA on the issuance of receipts to customers for money-changing transactions.




These provisions require JAGS, as a reporting institution (RI), to maintain proper records of transactions supported by receipts and to conduct CDD on its customers. The requirement to issue receipts is to protect customers in the event of disputes, while the CDD requirement enables RIs to assess their exposure to money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF) risks. This includes taking appropriate measures to prevent RIs from facilitating ML/TF and other serious crime activities.




BNM detected these non-compliances during an on-site examination. The non-compliances with CDD requirements and the non-issuance of a receipt occurred due to the actions of a former JAGS employee.




In response, JAGS has taken remedial measures by enhancing its guidelines for employees and strengthening its monitoring mechanism to ensure compliance with internal processes and procedures, as well as BNM requirements.




In deciding to impose the AMP and compound, BNM considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including:




(a) severity of the non-compliances;




(b) JAGS’ current controls to ensure compliance with the requirements, which were assessed as generally adequate.




(c) JAGS’ past compliance record; and




(d) JAGS’s post-misconduct behaviour and the effectiveness of the remedial actions taken by JAGS to prevent the recurrence of non-compliances.




JAGS paid RM17,400 for the AMP on 30 September 2025, and RM69,600 for the compound on 7 August 2025.




BNM requires all RIs to ensure compliance with AML/CFT and money services business requirements. BNM will not hesitate to take appropriate supervisory and enforcement actions should any RIs fail to meet legal or regulatory requirements.




The enforcement action taken is in line with the approach and processes outlined in the published 

[Enforcement Approach](https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/62604/BNM-Enforcement-Approach-1-Edition-2024.pdf)

.




 







[[1]](#_ftnref1)

 BNM imposed the AMP pursuant to section 75(2)(b) of the Money Services Business Act 2011.




[[2]](#_ftnref2)

 The AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD was in effect from 1 January 2020 to 5 February 2024 and has since been superseded by the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism, Countering Proliferation Financing and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD), which took effect on 6 February 2024. These requirements are preserved under paragraphs 14C.1(b), 14C.12.1 and 14C.4(a) of the AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD.

 BNM imposed the compound pursuant to section 88(1) of the MSBA.

On 23 September 2025, an enforcement action was taken against Armania Resources and Garuda Ventures Travel Sdn. Bhd. for suspicion of operating money services businesses without a valid license from Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), as well as potentially engaging in money laundering activities.




The above entities were investigated under subsection 4(1) of the Money Services Business Act 2011 [Act 731] ('MSBA') and subsection 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 [Act 613] ('AMLA').




The enforcement action was undertaken by BNM, with the assistance of the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP). This operation is part of continuous enforcement actions to protect members of the public against potential financial risks when dealing with unlicensed entities in the country.




A total of eight premises in various parts of Perak and Penang were raided. All relevant documents, electronic devices and cash amounting to RM65,487.00 were seized to assist the investigation. In addition, 27 accounts from financial institutions, Lembaga Tabung Haji, Amanah Saham Bumiputera and Wise Payments Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. were frozen.




Under subsection 4(1) of the MSBA, any person who commits an offence for conducting money services business without a license, on conviction, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and a fine of not less than RM50,000.00 but not exceeding RM5,000,000.00. Whereas, an offence under subsection 4(1) of the AMLA

[[1]](#_ftn1)

, on conviction shall be liable to imprisonment for up to 15 years and also shall be liable to a fine of at least five times the value of the proceeds of an unlawful activity or RM5,000,000.00, whichever is higher.




BNM would like to remind the public that operating a money services business without a valid license from BNM is an offence. Members of the public are urged to only deal with licensed money services businesses to safeguard their financial interests. A list of licensed money services businesses can be found at 

[bnm.gov.my/licensed-msb-operators.](https://www.bnm.gov.my/licensed-msb-operators)




If you are aware of any unlicensed entity, do not hesitate to report to BNM 

[here](https://bnmlink.bnm.gov.my/)

.




 




 







[[1]](#_ftnref1)

 Under subsection 4(1) of the AMLA, any person who:







- engages, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that involves proceeds of unlawful activity or instrumentalities of an offence;





- acquires, receives, possesses, disguises, transfers, converts, exchanges, carries, disposes of or uses proceeds of an unlawful activity or instrumentalities of an offence;





- removes from or brings into Malaysia, proceeds of an unlawful activity or instrumentalities of an offence; or





- conceals, disguises or impedes the establishment of the true nature, origin, location, movement, disposition, title of, rights with respect to, or ownership of, proceeds of an unlawful activity or instrumentalities of an offence,








commits a money laundering offence.

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) had, on 19 June 2025, imposed an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)

[[1]](#_ftn1)

 of RM340,000 on Alipay Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (Alipay) for non-compliances with paragraph 48(1)(a) of the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA). This is read together with paragraphs 27.3.5, 27.3.7, 27.4.2, 27.6.1, and 27.7.1 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD).

[[2]](#_ftn2)




Under the AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD, reporting institutions (RIs) are required to update the sanctions database upon publication of the Domestic List

[[3]](#_ftn3)

 and United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) List

[[4]](#_ftn4)

. They are also required to conduct sanctions screening on their entire customer database for any positive name match upon publication of the respective lists by the relevant authorities without delay. Upon any match to its customer, RIs are required to freeze the customer’s funds and submit a report to BNM without delay.




The non-compliances were discovered by BNM following Alipay’s report of several transactions conducted by a customer identified as a specified entity

[[5]](#_ftn5)

 of the Domestic List.  Alipay had failed to update its internal sanctions database following changes to the Domestic List upon publication in the Gazette. This impacted the subsequent screening of its customers, and the delay in freezing the customer’s account and reporting to BNM.




Alipay has since revised its internal policies and processes to ensure prompt update of its sanctions database and subsequent screening, freezing and reporting of any specified entities.  




In determining the imposition of the AMP, BNM considered the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including:







- the seriousness of the breaches which led to transactions being conducted by the sanctioned individual;





- lack of reasonable care by Alipay in complying with sanctions screening requirements;





- this is Alipay’s first non-compliance of such nature; and





- the assessment of Alipay’s post-conduct behaviour, including the remedial actions taken to rectify its policies and procedures.








Alipay paid RM340,000 for the AMP imposed by BNM on 3 July 2025.




The enforcement action taken is in line with the approach and processes outlined in the 

[Enforcement Approach](https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/62604/BNM-Enforcement-Approach-1-Edition-2024.pdf)

.




 







[[1]](#_ftnref1)

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) had, on 28 August 2024, imposed an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)

[[1]](#_ftn1)

 of RM193,500 on Syarikat S.M. Ziaudeen Sdn. Bhd. (SSMZ) for non-compliances with customer due diligence (CDD) and ongoing due diligence (ODD) requirements under sections 74 and 75(1)(b) of the Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA). This is read together with paragraphs 14C.10.1, 14C.12.1, 14C.10.5 and 14C.14.1 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD)

[[2]](#_ftn2)

.




Under the AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD, reporting institutions (RIs) are required to conduct CDD and ODD on its customers. These requirements aim to protect customers in the event of disputes and enable RIs to assess their exposure to money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF) risks. This includes taking appropriate measures to prevent RIs from facilitating ML/TF and other serious crime activities.




BNM detected these non-compliances during an on-site examination. SSMZ failed to conduct CDD on individual and corporate customers in relation to twenty two money-changing transactions exceeding RM3,000 each.

[[3]](#_ftn3)

 SSMZ also failed to conduct ODD on one customer’s transaction despite being flagged as high risk in its system. In response, SSMZ has taken remedial measures by strengthening its standard operating procedures and enhancing employee training.




In deciding to impose the AMP, BNM considered relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including:







- the degree of culpability of employees in the firm, leading to the non-compliances;





- the effectiveness of controls in place to detect and prevent non-compliances;





- SSMZ’s past compliance record; and





- remedial actions taken by SSMZ to prevent the recurrence of non-compliance.








SSMZ paid RM193,500 for the AMP imposed by BNM on 28 August 2025.




The enforcement action taken is in line with the approach and processes outlined in the 

[Enforcement Approach](https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/62604/BNM-Enforcement-Approach-1-Edition-2024.pdf)

.




 







[[1]](#_ftnref1)

 BNM issued the AMP pursuant to section 75(2)(b) of the Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA).




[[2]](#_ftnref2)

 The AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD was in effect from 1 January 2020 to 5 February 2024 and has since been superseded by the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism, Countering Proliferation Financing and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions Policy Document (AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD), which took effect on 6 February 2024. These requirements are preserved under paragraphs 14C.10.1, 14C.12.1, 14C.10.5 and 14C.14.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF and TFS for FIs PD.




[[3]](#_ftnref3)

 Under paragraph 14C.12.1 of the AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD, RIs must conduct CDD and obtain the relevant information, for transactions involving an amount between RM3,000 to RM10,000.
