Note:

 Potential clone entity

 refers to entities that may impersonate legitimate organisations or entities, presenting themselves as authentic while attempting to replicate the identity, branding or operations of the legitimate organisation/entity including business name, logo and business registration details. These entities are flagged as 'potential clone entity' due to their resemblance to the legitimate entity and likelihood of misleading others.
